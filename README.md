# TimeSeries
Practicing Time Series with ARIMA and FB Prophet.

I got this file (AEP_hourly.csv) from soumilshah1995 (github handle). It contains 10 years of hourly energy consumption from PJM in MegaWatts. PJM is a regional transmission organization (RTO) that coordinated the movement  of electricity in the Eastern part of the US.

I learned that you can also find this staset in Kaggle.

I am going to use Naive Methods to do forecasts. Then I will try ARIMA, SARIMA and FBProphet.
It is my intention to use also Strutural Time Series and finaly, at least for now, use some RandomeForest and XGboost
