# TimeSeries
Practicing Time Series with ARIMA and FB Prophet.

I got this file (AEP_hourly.csv) from soumilshah1995 (github handle). It contains 10 years of hourly energy consumption from PJM in MegaWatts. PJM is a regional transmission organization (RTO) that coordinated the movement  of electricity in the Eastern part of the US.
